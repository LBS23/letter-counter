# Letter Counter
I made my first project completely, is a simple letter counter. It returns a dictionary with all the letters in the text you input, the text must be encoded in "UTF-8."

1. Save the text in the folder in the same folder for a guarantee of it working.
2. Open the .py file and follow its directions.
3. Done!
